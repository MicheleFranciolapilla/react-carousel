# CAROUSEL WITH REACT

## One of my very first training projects in React.

### The exercise requested by the teachers focused on a carousel of randomly selected images from the web, navigable through specific buttons and entirely written in React. I wanted to shape the project into something more engaging and visually interesting, rather than replicating the same carousel for the umpteenth time. So, I came up with the idea of creating a comic carousel, and I chose Dylan Dog's comic, to which I am very attached, as it has been my favorite comic since adolescence and beyond. I spent some time downloading images and information from the web, and finally, I started coding.

#### To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository to your computer:**
git clone https://github.com/MicheleFranciolapilla/react-carousel.git

2. **Navigate to the project folder using the terminal or command prompt:**
cd path/to/project

3. **Install npm and Node.js:**
*If you don't have npm and Node.js installed on your computer, you can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).*

4. **Install project dependencies:**
npm install
*This command will read the dependencies specified in the `package.json` file and install them.*
